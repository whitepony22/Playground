# Grace's Playground 🛝

A fun little corner of the web where I’ve collected some of the mini web projects I’ve built along the way. From aesthetic experiments to form design and creative JavaScript challenges, this site brings them all together in one playful space.

### What You'll Find:
- Forms I made while learning HTML/CSS
- A drum machine and a calculator
- A markdown previewer
- A quote generator
- A Pomodoro timer
- An SSLC grade calculator
- A pretty UI ✧.*

Mostly built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — with a few React projects in the mix.  
It’s a learning playground, and I keep adding to it when something new clicks ✨
